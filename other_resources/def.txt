Def of Equitable Partition:
A partition P of a graph G = {v,e,w} is equitable if  for any two elements C_1, C_2 of the patititon we have that:
there exists a k s.t. for all i in C_1 \sum_{j \in C_2} A_{i,j} = k
for A, the adjecency matrix of G.

Def of Automorphism:
A permutation \sigma of the nodes of a graph G = {v,e,w} is automorphic iff A_{i,j} = A_{\sigma(i),\sigma(j)}
for A the adjecency matrix of G.

Def of Orbit and Orbital Partition:
Let G= {v,e,w} be a graph. If H \subset Aut(G) is a collection of automorphisms of G then nodes i and j are similar under H if there iscists an automorphism in H maping i onto j. The equivilence classes defined by this similarity are the orbits of the graph under H. A partition of G formed by a collection of orbits is an orbital partition of G.

Def of Cut:
A cut of a graph is a partition of the nodes with exactly two elements.
A cut is equitable of one of the elements of the cut is an orbit.
A cut is semi-equitable if one of the elements of the cut contains an orbit.

Thm (Nessicary Cond for same Part):
let i,j \in \underscore{G}_B. If \tau(i) = \tau(j) and \tau(in(i)) = \tau(in(j)) then i and j are in the same element of the coarsest equitable partition of \underscore{G}

proof:
Let i and j be as given above.
Consider the coarsest equitable partition of \underscore{G}, P. Suppose, by way of contradiction, that there exists some element of P, C, s.t.
\sum_{h \in C} A_{i,h} \neq \sum{h \in C} A_{j,h}.
This implies WLOG that there is some edge e from a vertex v \in C to node i, but no such edge to node j.
There are two cases:
	Case 1 v \in B:
		However by assumption we have that \tau(in(i)) = \tau(in(j)) which means that any edge from the base to i must have been copied s.t. there is a corrosponding edge from the base to j. A contradiction
	Case 2 v \in SCC:
		However, by the definition of specialization, the exact structure of the SCC that contains i is copied s.t. the structure of the SCC containting j is isomorphic.
Hence, by way of contradiction,\sum_{h \in C} A_{i,h} = \sum{h \in C} A_{j,h}
